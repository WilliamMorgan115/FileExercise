# FileExercise
 
This program will create a text file that says "Hello and Welcome!" It will create a struct that holds three values, then create 3 objects for that struct. It will then create a folder called "Contacts" and store the data of those objects in separate text files. These objects will be cleared out in the code, but not in the folder. The function DeSerialize will grab the data in those files and reassign them to the proper variables in the objects. The program will print out the data to show that it worked. No input is needed.
